RUN INSTRUCTIONS
Run from command line using this format
[Interpreter] GitHubJobs.py [DatasourceID] [Test mode True/False]
[Interpreter] GitHubSpider.py [DatasourceID] [Test mode True/False]

The use of test mode must be marker by 'True' with exact capitalization and spelling, as the argument is based off of a string variable.

A text file will need to be created. The name of this file must be dbInfo.txt and have the following lines:
server
port
username
password
database

When using test mode a text file with the same lines must be created as dbInfoTest.txt

After the spider run, run
[Interpreter] GitHubCleanUp.py [DatasourceID] [Test mode True/False]
Then rerun the spider as mentioned. This will clean up any projects left in the In_Progress state due to machine error.
