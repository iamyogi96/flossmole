#summary About FLOSSmole Freshmeat Datasets

=Freshmeat=
Every month we download Freshmeat's own XML file of information about projects listed on Freshmeat.

_We parse this XML file for the following information_
* Project names (long and short names)
* Project descriptions
* Project URL (the Freshmeat URL and the 'real' project URL)
* Project license(s)
* Project author(s)
* Project stats (vitality, popularity, etc, as determined by Freshmeat)
* Project trove categories

After the interesting variables are parsed out of the pages and stored in the database, we [downloading release the data] in several different formats. 

_Frequently asked questions_

  #How come you don't provide the trove categories in the file downloads?

We'd really like to make some sense of the trove categories, actually. Ideally, we'd like to relate each numeric trove category to a textual description of that trove category, and create a "key" table for this information. Then we'd feel more comfortable releasing the trove categories for each project. [community Let us know] if you'd like to work on this.
