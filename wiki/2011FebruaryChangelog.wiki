==February 10, 2011==
  * Running Launchpad
  * Google Code still running (it's on developers)
  * As part of the DOI project I decided to finally get all the file releases into one location and to write a db-driven script system for doing file releases. 
  * This means that the SF site will basically just hold our mailing list for now. At some point I'll move that too.
  # Copy all files from grid0 to local
  # copy all files from SF to local
  # this should give me a complete set
  # move any files from this set NOT already on Google Code up there
  # fill new DB tables with DOI info
  # write a script to generate new DOI records
  # update release scripts to take into account new tables
  # generate new DOI records and send to company
  # test new release system with January data
