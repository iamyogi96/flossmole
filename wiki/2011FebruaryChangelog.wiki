==February 15, 2011==
TODO
  * Release all January data
  * Pick up DOI where we left off
  * Launchpad is still chugging along
  * github is still broken
==February 14, 2011==
  * Google increased our disk storage. File uploads are now finished.
  * Google Code parser has been re-written as of this afternoon; was getting errors on labels, activity levels, etc. Added functionality for groups.
  * Carter added column to Debian release data; I can now release the Debian metrics as soon as I get the data moved from dev into production.

==February 11, 2011==
  * moved many older legacy data files from SF to GC, but blocked on this task since the uploader quit working - I suspect we are out of disk space? Here is the error:
{{{
flossmole$ python googlecode_upload.py --summary="Sourceforge Project Descriptions: 2007-Aug" --project=flossmole --user=megansquire --password=password sfProjectDesc2007-Aug.txt.bz2
Please enter your googlecode.com username: 
}}}

No matter what I enter, it just asks for the password, then fails. (It should not even get this far since the username is given on the commandline. This just suddenly stopped working today after I had uploaded about 700 files between yesterday and today using this identical method.) In the past I have gotten this error when two things were wrong (1) ran out of disk space (2) badly formed .bz2 file. (I tested the bzipping in this case, and it was fine.)

==February 10, 2011==
  * Running Launchpad
  * Google Code still running (it's on developers)
  * As part of the DOI project I decided to finally get all the file releases into one location and to write a db-driven script system for doing file releases. 
  * This means that the SF site will basically just hold our mailing list for now. At some point I'll move that too.
  # Copy all files from grid0 to local
  # copy all files from SF to local
  # this should give me a complete set
  # move any files from this set NOT already on Google Code up there
  # fill new DB tables with DOI info
  # write a script to generate new DOI records
  # update release scripts to take into account new tables
  # generate new DOI records and send to company
  # test new release system with January data

==February 9, 2011==
  * working on new tables to hold information about releases. This will be used to generate DOI information.

==February 8, 2011==
  * add bugs to google
  * create new feature list
  * some notes on federated search and data integration

==February 7, 2011==

==February 6, 2011==
  * github collector broken; bug submitted to snorris
==February 4, 2011==
