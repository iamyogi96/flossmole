#summary About the FLOSSmole Objectweb data

= Introduction =

Every month we download data from the ObjectWeb web site about the projects hosted on that site.

First we construct a list of all projects, then we grab the html page for EACH project and we then save this to our database. From these pages, we parse out the relevant information about a project and save it in our database also.

After the interesting variables are parsed out of the pages and stored in the database, we [downloading release the data] in several different formats.

_Some of the data elements we have available for you to download are:_

  * Developers (name, username, etc)
  * Developers on each project (username, role on project, whether they are an admin or not
  * Project description (textual)   
  * Project environment(s)
  * Project names (long name and short 'unixname')
  * Project activity percentile
