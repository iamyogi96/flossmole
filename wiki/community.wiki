#summary About the FLOSSmole Community

= Introduction =

A number of resources are available for communicating with the FLOSSmole developers and with the community of open source researchers that use FLOSSmole:
  * [http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=119453 Our mailing list] - low volume, but come join the conversation!
  * [http://ossmole.sf.net Our blog]
