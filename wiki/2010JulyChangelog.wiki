This is a reverse-chronological log of things we've done on this project for the month of July 2010. Think of it as a journal of changes and features. An attempt at non-email-based institutional memory.

  * google code is done. Miracle! Now to parse it. Sigh.
  * parsing requires pulling the following from main page and put into projects table:
    * code license
    * content license (opt)
    * activity level 

=== Database Administration ===
{{{
 ALTER TABLE `gc_projects` ADD `code_license` VARCHAR( 100 ) NULL COMMENT 'code license chosen',
ADD `activity_level` VARCHAR( 50 ) NULL COMMENT 'the word describing the activity level',
ADD `content_license` VARCHAR( 100 ) NULL COMMENT 'content license (optional)';
}}}
