Run Instructions:
All runs are passed with two arguments, as follows:

Steps 1-3 are a run set to collect all pages (excluding mailing lists) for each project. These steps
do not depend on any other steps.
Steps 4 and 5 are a run set to collect all mailing list pages. These steps depend on steps 1-3, 
but do not have to be run every time run set 1-3 is run.
